# Facility Meltdown 
The apparatus was a vital part of the upkeep of the facility's nuclear reactor - and you just took it out.

With the facility meltdown mod the appartus has a lot more risk (and reward) attached to it. When you take it out the entire facility spirals into a self destruction sequence! You'll have 2 minutes to escape and take off before you get vaporized.

FacilityMeltdown will work with most custom moons and all interiors.
### HELP! When meltdown happenes this modded moon turns red!
This is known and comes from modded moon creators not setting up in the exact way that vanilla moons are setup (which is fine). They will need to add explict support as it's not something I can really fix on my end. If you're a moon creator and this issue is happening to you, ask in my thread on the modded lethal company discord how to add support!

If you are strugling with playing the mod have a look at the bottom of this readme to find some useful tips and tricks. Or you can modify certain things in the config.

Music and voice lines come from portal 2. I love portal 2.

## What this mod adds
- A 2 minute meltdown sequence where everything begins to go wrong inside the facility. After the 2 minutes is up the nuclear reactor blows up into a fireball that will engulf you if you aren't fast enough.
- A new piece of Equipment - the Geiger Counter! For just 90 credits you can be surverying the area for radiation in no time! Use it to find the appartus or other places of radioactive significance.
- A new terminal command - "reactor health"! When the facility's reactor is melting down you need information! The reactor health command is here to provide you with vital information on how much time left you have until the facility goes catastrophic. It also includes what the company thinks you should do at this moment.

## Custom Music
### with PizzaTowerEscapeMusic
FacilityMeltdown itself doesn't support custom music. However, this tutorial made by "platinumbin" on Discord shows you how to use the [PizzaTowerEscapeMusic](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/BGN/PizzaTowerEscapeMusic/) mod to add custom music.

### with loaforcsSoundAPI
[loaforcsSoundAPI](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/loaforc/loaforcsSoundAPI/) is a mod I built specfically for the LR team. There is a template avaliable [here](https://github.com/LoafOrc/loaforcsSoundAPI-examples), otherwise read the [getting started wiki](https://github.com/LoafOrc/loaforcsSoundAPI/wiki/Making-a-simple-Sound%E2%80%90Pack).
**This tool is still in development and I recommened using PizzaTowerEscapeMusic for now**
However this comes with the added bonus of being able to use Meltdown's dynamic system of speeding up the warning voice sounds as the meltdown occurs.

## Config
All game balance options are synced (only the host needs to edit them, but it wont hurt to have everyone using the same config). Visual and Audio settings are independent of what is synced.

### OPTIONAL ingame config editors
[lethalconfig](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/AinaVT/LethalConfig/) or [lethalsettings](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/willis81808/LethalSettings/) will let you edit the settings in-game.

### Tips and Tricks
- Make sure you plan your route before you take it. It's most likely you have time to double check you know where to go.
- Having someone at the ship and running the "reactor health" command can give vital information on how much time you have left.
- Pay attention to the inside of the facility! As the reactor inside of the facility begins to fail you'll notice more and more explosions happening. You'll also get another radiation warning at exactly halfway.
- Your ship is safe from the explosion! The ship will automatically take off as the explosion occurs. As long as you are inside the ship before it takes off you will be 100% safe.
- Lastly is to stay calm! It can be hard with all the enemies, noises and explosions but panicking is the easiest way to lose focus and forget where to go.
