## v2.6
- Entire rewrite of the config system.
- Meltdown now entirely handles config syncing, CSync is no longer a dependency.

### v2.6.1
- Added more protection if meltdown fails to setup some effects.
- Fixed meltdown starting twice ig?

### v2.6.2
- Fixed accidently clearing client configs.

### v2.6.3
- Fixed Geiger Counter
- Fixed ship and map props lights turning red.
- Changed how the outside lights flash, should no longer be an all consuming void. 

### v2.6.4
- Hopefully fixed some windows locales being unable to load meltdown.

### v2.6.5
- Fixed explosion particles being pink.
- Added a new config option, `MinPeopleToPullApparatus`. Default is 2. Requires at least this many people. If this number is larger than the amount of people in the lobby then EVERYBODY will need to be nearby.
- Lobby Compatibility is no longer a "hard" dependency but will remain a dependency on thunderstore. If it is causing issues you can disable it and meltdown will still work.

### v2.6.6
- Fixed MinPeopleToPullAPparatus not taking into account dead people :skull:

### v2.6.7
- Fixed Config not syncing correctly.

### v2.6.8
- Applied Hotfix on GeneralImprovements to unbreak the tooltip when you need more people to pull the apparatus.
- `MinPeopleToPullApparatus` now only applies to 9PM. After 9PM anybody can grab the apparatus, regardless of how many people are nearby.

### v2.6.9
- Removed GeneralImprovements hotfix as it was fixed in v1.2.7 :3

### v2.6.10
- Reapplied the hotfix LMAO.

### v2.6.11
