### v2.5
- Reorganised the entire project. Mods like MeltdownChance, PizzaProbability and FacilityMeltdownPatch will most likely be broken by these changes.
- Lang files are no longer embedded and loaded at all times.
- Geiger Counter recieves a buff, the apparatice now emits more radiation over a longer distance.
- Outside facility lights will now also flash.
 - Creators of custom moons can add a MeltdownMoonMapper to customise what lights will flash.
Temporarily removed the dependency on LethalLib.

TODO:
- Finish removing TerminalAPI as a dependency
- Support LethalAchievements
- LobbyCompatibility integration/dependency.
